# Feature Specification: Household Power Consumption Estimator

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application to estimate household power consumption by listing each appliance with its name, average power usage, daily hours of use, and the days of the week it is used."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A household member wants to understand their electricity usage patterns and costs by cataloging their appliances and tracking when they use each device. They need to add appliances with power ratings, set usage schedules, see estimated consumption and costs over different time periods, and visualize their upcoming week's power consumption through an interactive chart to better plan their energy usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty appliance list, **When** user adds a refrigerator (150W, 24 hours/day, all days), **Then** system shows daily consumption of 3.6 kWh
2. **Given** existing appliances in the system, **When** user adds a washing machine (500W, 1 hour/day, weekdays only), **Then** system updates total weekly consumption estimate
3. **Given** multiple appliances with different schedules, **When** user views monthly estimate, **Then** system calculates total consumption accounting for partial week usage
4. **Given** appliance data entered, **When** user modifies an appliance's daily hours, **Then** system immediately updates all consumption estimates and the visual chart
5. **Given** a complete appliance list, **When** user views the next week chart, **Then** system displays daily consumption predictions with breakdown by appliance
6. **Given** multiple appliances with different schedules, **When** user hovers over a day in the chart, **Then** system shows detailed breakdown of which appliances contribute to that day's consumption
7. **Given** a complete appliance list, **When** user exports consumption report, **Then** system provides breakdown by appliance and time period

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters invalid power ratings (negative watts, unrealistic values)?
- How does system handle appliances used less than daily (e.g., 3 times per week)?
- What occurs when user tries to delete an appliance that's part of saved calculations?
- How does system respond to extremely high consumption estimates that may indicate data entry errors?
- How does the chart display when there are no appliances entered?
- What happens when chart data becomes too dense (many appliances, complex schedules)?
- How does the chart handle appliances with irregular usage patterns across the week?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add household appliances with name, average power consumption in watts, daily hours of use, and days of week used
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate power consumption values (positive numbers, reasonable ranges for household appliances)
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate daily, weekly, and monthly energy consumption estimates for individual appliances
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate total household consumption across all appliances
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to edit or delete existing appliances
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist appliance data between sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST display consumption estimates in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support partial week usage patterns (e.g., weekdays only, weekends only, specific days)
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to view consumption breakdown by appliance
- **FR-010**: System MUST calculate estimated electricity costs when given rate per kWh
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide export functionality for consumption reports
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate daily hours input (0-24 hours range)
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle appliances with standby power consumption vs. active use
- **FR-014**: System MUST display a visual chart showing estimated power consumption for the next 7 days
- **FR-015**: Chart MUST show daily total consumption and allow breakdown view by appliance
- **FR-016**: Chart MUST be interactive with hover details showing specific appliance contributions
- **FR-017**: Chart MUST update in real-time when appliance data is modified
- **FR-018**: Chart MUST be accessible to screen readers with alternative data presentation
- **FR-019**: Chart MUST handle edge cases gracefully (no data, overlapping schedules, high appliance counts)
- **FR-020**: Chart MUST display consumption values with appropriate units (kWh) and time labels

### Key Entities
- **Appliance**: Represents a household device with name, power rating in watts, daily usage hours, usage days pattern, and optional standby power consumption
- **Usage Schedule**: Represents the days of the week and hours per day an appliance operates
- **Consumption Estimate**: Represents calculated energy usage for specific time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) for individual appliances or household totals
- **Rate Setting**: Represents electricity cost per kWh for cost estimation calculations
- **Weekly Forecast**: Represents projected daily consumption values for the next 7 days with appliance-level breakdown
- **Chart Data Point**: Represents a single day's consumption data including total consumption and contributing appliances for visualization
